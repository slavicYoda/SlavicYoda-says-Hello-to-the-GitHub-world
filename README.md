my quick hello to GitHub

Hi,

I am seasoned white (well, I prefer shirts with blue collars but "blue collar" refers to factory workers in America) collar professional with years of experience in customer service spanning several different
industries (hospitality, financial services and publishing), acquired while working with and for American and foreign
clients (mostly in New York City), including top celebrity membership club in NYC as well as world’s number 1 custodian bank; with Can-Do attitude and risk, time and project management skills; familiar with challenges and risks related to providing top-notch level of client satisfaction. 

I possess, keen mind (don’t we all?) eloquence as well as developed writing skills (I have newspaper experience) and enjoy solving problems (did I mention I play chess?) and helping out others - all of which could greatly benefit your company.

I'd love to join GitHub team and hence my application. You can find out more about me in my resume and cover letter.

Kind regards,
Greg
